- [ ] How does Node's require function work?
    Basically, reads a file, assigns exports to global variables,
    so export functionality is scoped to that variable (effectively a namespace)


- [ ] From CodeFights, but still: how do you identify the number of places a base 10
number has in JS? How do you mathematically model that?
53 % 10 = 3
500 / 10 = 50...


- [ / ] From CodeFights, Sort By Height exercise, why does solution fail if you return forEach?
BECAUSE forEach doesn't return anything....it just does some action for each value in an array
In your case, that action is manipulating the actual array....which is a tad confusing
     [ ] Review how forEach works relative to the array its called on; just side effects
