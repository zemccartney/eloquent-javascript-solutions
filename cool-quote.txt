2 interfaces for naming and requesting documents distributed across systems, the web(?)

The web is, simply, a mass of resources (documents)
We name these resources with URIs
We ask each other for them using HTTP
The web is a massive, rapid, self-service, dynamic library that includes different media,
data processing, etc. more complex stuff than just static resources (books, articles)
